** Introduction
This is a project showing of the high speed routing capabilities within JITx. It is currently a work in progress towards an open source USB4/TBT4 to between 1 and 4 M.2 PCIe connectors based on the AsMedia ASM2464PDX chip.

The software used to write this complex design is JITx, a new and amazing code based EDA. Check out [JITx plans and **[start for free]** with them now.](https://hubs.la/Q02-p5-70)
