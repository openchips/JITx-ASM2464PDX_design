** Introduction
This is a project showing of the high speed routing capabilities within JITx. It is currently a work in progress towards an open source USB4/TBT4 to between 1 and 4 M.2 PCIe connectors based on the AsMedia ASM2464PDX chip.

The software used to write this complex design is JITx, a new and amazing code based EDA. Check out [JITx plans and **their free for open source license**.](https://hubs.la/Q02-p5-70)
Feel free to reach out to me or to their support on Discord to learn more, or plan a demo session to see how the future of PCB desgn will look like.
